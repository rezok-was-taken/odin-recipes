This is a simple project I did from The Odin Project. Nothing fancy in here.
Just testing out how HTML works. Tonight I learned:

-Basics of HTML. General purpose of tags like head or body
-Usage of headers h1. They go from h1 to h6. After research I did on my own I figured out I should use ONLY ONE h1 per page. Also - I shouldn't use h3 if I haven't used h2 before. 
-Creating ordered ol and unordered ul lists
-Adding links a and images img
